1. html from the browser extract by browser extension.
2. Browser extension send html string to go project.

3. Go project should take html string.

4. Then send html string to external service -> mercury 5009

        Content-Type: application/json
    body
        POST
        http://localhost:5009/process

        }


4. Ater getting response extract content.
5. Send content to txtpick

        ],
        "success": true
    }

6. After getting response. Take array from result.
7. Sent an array with help go_module to AquilaHub
    http://localhost:5002/compress
    header
        Content-Type: application/json
    body post:
        {

            }
        }

    response will be vectors array of arrays.
    Loop through it and make single payload in single array.

8. Take vectors and make 
    http://localhost:5001/db/doc/insert

    with token vectors
    every array is single object in payload

Request example:
------------------------

{
   "data": {
       "docs": [
           {
           "payload":
               {
                   "metadata": {

                   },
                   "code": [0.1, 0.2, 0.3]
               }
           },
           {
           "payload":

-------------------------------------

docInsert := &DocInsertRequestStruct{
		Data: DatatDocInsertStruct{
			Docs: []DocsStruct{
				{
					Payload: PayloadStruct{
